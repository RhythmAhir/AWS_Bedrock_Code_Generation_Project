# Project Report: Code Generation System with AWS Lambda, Bedrock, API Gateway, and Amazon S3

## 1. Introduction
This project involves building a serverless solution that generates code snippets based on user-provided instructions. Using **AWS Lambda** as the processing engine, we integrate with **AWS Bedrock** to leverage the foundational model **Anthropic Claude-v2** for natural language processing. This setup is accessed via **API Gateway**, allowing users to submit requests using tools like Postman, and the generated code is stored in an **S3 bucket** for easy retrieval.

---

## 2. **Creating the AWS Lambda Function**

The **AWS Lambda function** is the core of our code generation process. It utilizes **AWS Bedrock** to generate code based on user instructions, stores the generated code in an **S3 bucket**, and is accessible through **API Gateway** for external requests.

### Key Components of the Lambda Function

- **Code Generation with Bedrock**:
  - The `generate_code_using_bedrock` function prepares a prompt based on the userâ€™s request, specifying the programming language and instructions. This prompt is sent to Bedrock's **"Anthropic Claude-v2"** model for processing.

- **Storing Code in S3**:
  - The `save_code_to_s3_bucket` function saves the generated code in a specified **S3 bucket** with a unique key. Each file is saved in the `code-output` folder within the bucket, using a timestamped filename for easy tracking and retrieval.

- **Lambda Handler**:
  - The `lambda_handler` function receives **API Gateway** requests, parses the JSON payload, calls the code generation function, and, if successful, stores the output in S3. It then returns a successful response to the API Gateway.

The complete code for this Lambda function can be found in the **`Bedrock_Code_Generation.py`** file.

## 3. Configuring Bedrock Integration
Inside the Lambda function code, we integrate AWS Bedrock to use the **"Anthropic Claude-v2"** model for generating code based on user prompts.

- **Prompt Configuration**:
  - The prompt instructs the model on what language to use and what code to write based on user-supplied instructions.
  - Parameters like `temperature,` `max_tokens_to_sample,` and `stop_sequences` help control the quality and format of the generated response.

This integration is part of the Lambda function code and can be found in the **`Bedrock_Code_Generation.py`**.

## 4. Setting Up Amazon S3 for Code Storage
To store the generated code, we created an Amazon **S3 bucket** with a structured folder (e.g., `code-output`) to organize output files. The Lambda function automatically saves each code snippet in this bucket, using a timestamped filename for uniqueness.

## 5. Setting Up API Gateway for External Access
**API Gateway** was configured to allow external access to the Lambda function, enabling users to submit requests via HTTP POST. The configuration includes:

1. **Integration with Lambda**:
   - API Gateway routes the incoming requests to the Lambda function, passing along the JSON payload with user instructions.

2. **Defining Routes**:
   - A POST route (`/code-generation) was created in API Gateway, with integration set to invoke the Lambda function.

## 6. Testing the API with Postman
We tested the API by sending a POST request via **Postman** to verify the functionality. The request included a JSON payload specifying the programming language and instructions for generating a binary search implementation in Python.

1. **Postman Request**:
   - The POST request was configured to send JSON data:
     "`json
     {
       "key": "python",
       "message": "implement binary search"
     }
     ```

2. **API Response**:
   - The response confirmed successful execution, showing that the code generation and storage processes worked as expected.

## 7. Verifying Output in S3 Bucket
After the Lambda function completed execution, we checked the S3 bucket to confirm that the generated code was saved correctly. The file `implement_binary_search.py` appeared in the `code-output` folder, verifying that the system performed end-to-end as intended.

## 8. Viewing the Generated Code in S3
Here is the content of the generated Python code for binary search. This snippet was generated based on the prompt provided and saved in the S3 bucket:

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of **AWS Lambda**, Bedrock's **"Anthropic Claude-v2"** model, **API Gateway**, and **Amazon S3** to build a serverless, code-generating API. The structured approach and configuration ensure that code can be generated based on natural language instructions, saved securely, and accessed via a public-facing API. 

This solution can be a scalable foundation for similar projects requiring automated text or code generation, making it a versatile tool for developers, educators, and businesses.
